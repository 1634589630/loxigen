{"name":"Loxigen","tagline":"OpenFlow protocol bindings for multiple languages","body":"Introduction\r\n============\r\n\r\nLoxiGen is a tool that generates OpenFlow protocol libraries for a number of\r\nlanguages. It is composed of a frontend that parses wire protocol descriptions\r\nand a backend for each supported language (currently C, Python, and Java, with an \r\nauto-generated wireshark dissector in Lua on the way). \r\n\r\nLoxiGen currently supports OpenFlow Versions **1.0**, **1.1**, **1.2**, and **1.3.1**. Versions 1.0\r\nand 1.3.1 are actively used in production. Support for versions 1.1 and 1.2 is considered experimental.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrerequisites\r\n=============\r\n\r\nRunning the unit tests requires [nosetests](http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\r\nYou can install it via easy_install,\r\n```\r\neasy_install nose\r\n```\r\npip,\r\n```\r\npip install nose\r\n```\r\nor via your distribution's package manager (example for Debian/Ubuntu):\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-get install python-nose\r\n```\r\n\r\nNosetests is only required for running the unit tests, not for running LoxiGen\r\nitself. We do ask you to install it and use it before submitting pull requests,\r\nthough.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\nYou can run LoxiGen directly from the repository. There's no need to install it,\r\nand it has no dependencies beyond Python 2.7+.\r\n\r\nTo generate the libraries for all languages:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo generate the library for a single language:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake c\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe currently supported languages are `c`, `python` and `java`. There is an \r\nexperimental/partially completed backend that generates a lua wireshark dissector\r\n(`wireshark`).\r\n\r\nThe generated libraries will be under the `loxi_output` directory. This can be\r\nchanged with the `LOXI_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable when using the Makefile.\r\n\r\nEach generated library comes with its own set of documentation in the standard\r\nformat for that language. Please see that documentation for more details on\r\nusing the generated libraries.\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n============\r\n\r\nPlease fork the repository on GitHub and send us a pull request. You might also\r\nbe interested in the INTERNALS file which has notes about how LoxiGen works.\r\n\r\nLoxigen comes with a set of internal unit-tests, as well as with a set of tests\r\nfor the generated artifacts. Be sure to run\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake check-all\r\n```\r\n\r\nand correct any problems before submitting a pull request.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
